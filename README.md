# Paper-Rock-Scissors

The popular game, _Paper Rock Scissors_, has been a mainstay of fun and accessible hand games that everyone can play and enjoy for centuries! This is why, along my learning journey, I have decided to throw my hand in, creating a fun and basic version of this childhood favorite. To complete this exciting task, I needed to employ several techniques such as nesting math.random in math.floor to produce seemingly random responses from the computer, establishing a basic array from which the computer can draw its options ans inserting JavaScript logic into a WHILE loop for perpetual fun for all those who embark on this entertaining challenge . I hope you have fun!
